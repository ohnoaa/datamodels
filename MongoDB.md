### MongoDB

-   Website: <https://www.mongodb.com>

MongoDB is both an open-source and commercial database (for those who are interested, they can purchase the commercial version). To the best of my knowledge, I would consider MongoDB to be a non-relational data model - this is because it's formatted as a document-oriented program. The hosting model used for MongoDB is cloud-based through a service called Database-as-a-Service (DBaas). MongoDB actually supports 12 different languages, Java and Python included. For both Java and Python, an additional driver is required to download in order for MongoDB to connect and interact with the applications.
