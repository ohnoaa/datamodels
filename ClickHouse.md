### ClickHouse

-   Website: <https://clickhouse.com>

ClickHouse is an open-source database product. Because it is a column-based system, it would be considered a relational data model. In order to be able to run the system and use the data, ClickHouse can be hosted through the ClickHouse Cloud (therefore it uses the cloud model through its own program). In order to have Java access the database product, a client or driver needs to be installed for the specific language wanted. However, ClickHouse already has its own integration with Python in the system and the language is accessible through ClickHouse Connect.
