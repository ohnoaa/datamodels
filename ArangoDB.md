Arango is an open-source database product. Its database model was originally developed to be a graphical database, but now is a multi-modal system that also includes JSON documents and keys/values. To be able to host the database, you'll use ArangoDB's cloud service called Oasis. To connect Java or Python to the DBMS, you'll need to you install an additional driver and follow tutorials that are available on their website.
