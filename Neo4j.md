### Neo4j

-   Website: <https://neo4j.com>

Neo4j is a very interesting database product. They consider themselves a non-open-source product, not because it's commercial but due to the fact that it's a community-based product. Unlike any of the other database products, Neo4j is actually a network data model and uses graphs. If you want to use the product, Neo4j can be hosted by the cloud of your choice. Java was actually the primary language used to code the DBMS and with the support of the community, the system is accessible for Python as well without a driver (even though there are additional drivers for other languages if that's preferred).
