### IMS Database (IBM)

Paragraph

IMS Database, also known as IBM Information Management System, is a commercialized DBMS that is also a joint information management system. It uses the hierarchical data model to manage the data in the product. From my understanding, as this is a product of IBM, the IMS Database is hosted through a client/server model. To be able to access Java on the database a JDBC DriverManager interface must be installed. From what I can gather, with some additional steps the same driver can be used to access Python, but it isn't as direct.
