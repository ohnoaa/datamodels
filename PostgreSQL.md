### PostgreSQL

-   Website: <https://www.postgresql.org>

PostgreSQL is an open-source database product. It can be categorized as a object-relational data model. PostgreSQL is hosted through the cloud providers. PostgreSQL seems to be accessible through a multitude of different languages, even though it wasn't originally built with those functionalities. In order for Java or Python to access the database product, you'd have to download additional third-party libraries to connect it.
