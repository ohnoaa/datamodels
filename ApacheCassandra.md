### Apache Cassandra

-   Website: <https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html>

Apache Cassandra is an open-source, non-relational database product. It's non-relational because it doesn't relate to any of the other categories, relational, hierarchical, or network, and utilizes NoSQL. Most of the information about Apache Cassandra leads me to believe that it uses the cloud as its hosting model. Even though Apacha Cassandra introduces its own language, Cassandra Query Language (CQL), to access the interface, there are additional language drivers that make both Java and Python available to use it.
